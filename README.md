# w2p-social-auth
The master branch of this is now just a scaled back version of the original w2p-social-auth without version 0.1.24 included in the plugin.  This works with version 0.2.19 and 0.2.21 (latest) of python social auth at least for 4 providers tested so far and can be tested at the following link:  https://www.netdecisionmaking.com/w2ppsatest
