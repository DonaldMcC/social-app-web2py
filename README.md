# social-app-web2py
This project is to develop a working adaptor for web2py to work with the revised structure and naming of the new python social auth site at:  https://github.com/python-social-auth

The previous w2p-social-auth is now deprecated and development will take place on this repostory at least until working. In due course it is hoped this repository can then be adopted by python-social-auth.

Current status is that this appears to work withe version 0.0.1 of social-auth-core but errors on pipeline arguments with later releases.


# w2p-social-auth 
The master branch of this is now just a scaled back version of the original w2p-social-auth without version 0.1.24 included in the plugin.  This works with version 0.2.19 and 0.2.21 (latest) of python social auth at least for 4 providers tested so far and can be tested at the following link:  https://www.netdecisionmaking.com/w2ppsatest
